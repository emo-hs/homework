It helps  consumers and businesses to be instantly verified online by providing secure access to reliable, independent data sources worldwide. The company has its service verified 5 billion people and 330 million companies in over 100 countries. According to [CNBC DISRUPTOR 50](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/trulioo-disruptor-50.html), the idea for Trulioo was triggered by a CNN news which was about how profound effect was on an Indian women after first seeing her Facebook profile.Then Stephen and Tanis realised there are lots of people in the world do not have a cyber identity or any record of their existence and started Trulioo. 

The company has rasied a total of **$80.8M** in funding over 8 rounds.

## Business Activities:

Trulioo is a hyper-growth Canada startup dealing with global identity challenges. Know your customer also known as KYC, one of the most serious issues among industries espcially financial area, is what this company try to solve in order to prevent financial fraud.

Every single company from Fortune 500s to SMBs that needs to do identity verification is the target customer of Trulioo. While, although there are countless target industries, the loyal customers of company come from banking, payments, market places&communities and gaming. Now because of COVID-19, a majority of transactions are through internet which makes ID verification crucial and helps Trulioo expand hugely among SMBs. As the potential clients are spread all over the industry, it is hard to calculate the market size, but we can ensure it is huge. 

Based on [REGTECH SUPPIER PERFORMANCE REPORT](https://www.trulioo.com/blog/regtech-supplier-performance-report-2019) (2019), GlobalGateway, Trulioo's ID verification platform, has been ranked NO.1 for four consecutive years in the Verification Tools / Identity Checks category. There are two exclusive features contribute to such success of this electronic identity verification (eIDV) platform. First of all, comparing to other companies in identity verification field, Trulioo has a much huger rigorous checked identity networks come from  mobile network operators (MNOs), international watchlists, credit bureaus, government and more which provides holistic digital identities of 5 billion people and 330 million companies across 195+ countries ([Trulioo](https://www.trulioo.com/resources/faqs),2020). Secondly, clients can easily connect to over 400 trusted data sources through an one intergrated and single API platform, GlobalGateway, which saves large amount of time and costs on searching independent data sources and maintaining multple APIs.These comparative advantages streamline the onboarding and compliant process that helps it become one of the most disruptive fintech companies.

There are several technologies used by Trulioo to ensure authenticity of business and personal identity and comply with changing regulation environment. Single integration API , as mentioned before, is core technology of the company. According to [Trulioo FAQ](https://www.trulioo.com/resources/faqs) (2020), it builds a normalized API which is vendor and country-agnostic so as to provide a consistent and standardized data set across all available countries for client service integration. In this way, clients can cutomize and integrate the platform into their system or website cost-effective. "The GlobalGateway API is a stateless web service based on RESTful architecture and uses built-in HTTP features, such as HTTP authentication, errors and verbs which are understood by standard HTTP clients" ([DEVELPOR PORTAL](https://developer.trulioo.com/v1.0/reference#technical-overview), 2020). It also utilizes some cutting edge technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and biometrics to verify documents and check for liveness. An image capture SDK has recently been released to enhance the customer experience on document verification by helping them take images of document easier ([New Trulioo image capture SDK](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202002/new-trulioo-image-capture-sdk-to-help-ease-id-document-verification-and-workflow), 2020). Although Trulioo does not contain users' clients information, it does collect personal information such as identifiers, historical transctions, geolocation data and professional infomation. These data is stored and processed by third parties: Marketo, Instapage, Zapier, and Salesforce by leverageing cloud storage technology ([Trulioo Privcy Policy](https://www.trulioo.com/privacy), 2020)

## Landscape:

Regulation technology, also known as RegTech, applies emerging technology to manage regulatory requirements within financial industry. With rapid expansion of RegTech over the recent five years, [Deloitt](https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/technology/articles/regtech-companies-compliance.html)(2020) finds this universe is made up of 378 regtech companies and can be divided into 5 segments which are regulatory reporting, risk management, identity management and control, compliance and transaction monitoring. Trulioo is one of the fastest growth and disruptive Regtechs in identity management and control field. It is also one of the top 100 Regtech companies in 2020 ([regtech100](https://fintech.global/regtech100/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RegTech100_2020_Summary.pdf), 2020). 

Following the global financial crisis in 2008, the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act were introduced to turn the regulatory environment from under-regulated to over-regulated. It costed a huge amount of penalty and massive increased compliance cost for financial institutions worldwide which leads to the advent of RegTech. Regtech solutions are lack of trust at first, however, because of the complex and broadth of KYC and AML policies in different regulatory bodies, investors soon understood the opportunity and step into it. According to the [RegTech Analyst](http://member.regtechanalyst.com/large-deals-over-50m-drive-global-regtech-investment-to-over-17bn-since-2015/), in 2015 there were 149 RegTech investment deals across the world, totaling $1.1 billion. Just four years later those numbers had jumped up to 317 deals totaling $8.5 billion. It is forecasted that the value of this industry will be around $120 billion ([WHAT IS REGTECH?](https://builtin.com/fintech/regtech-companies), Daley, 2019).

With the evolution of AI, machine learning, API platform, big data and cloud calculation, compliance programmes can be designed to automated and streamline process of monitoring, checking, and report generation which minimizes the human error and ensures their users to comply with across-the-borad regulatory compliance in a more efficient and effective way. It can also provide services include employee surveillance, compliance data management, fraud prevention, and audit trail capabilities. These functions can easily be compatible and adjusted with exitsing system by using APIs. It is expect that an increase number of regulators, for example FCA, to leverage RegTech to degitalise and decode policies and put innovative RegTech into consideration. Some major players in this domain include Silverfinch, Trunomi, IdentiyMind, Suade, Ascent Regtech and Chainalysis.

## Results

 Trulioo has rapid growth business impact which is contributed by its extrememly large data sources to help organisations verify the identities of more than five billion people which is almost two their of global population, 250 million businesses across 195 countries in just one single API platform. It figured out how to contain a large part of 'unbanked' population especially in developing countries into their data sources through help of mobile network operators in order to achieve financial inclusion. During the coronavirus pandemic, the company brings three month free identity verification with facial recognition services for small businesses along with American Express to remove financial distress for them. 

According to [The Global RegTech Industry Benchmark Report](https://regtech.org.au/resources/Documents/2019-ccaf-global-regtech-benchmarking-report.pdf)(2018), as most of the Regtech companies are just in the start-up stage, performance benchmark should hugely base on funding rounds. The report found in North America the average raised $22.8 million in over two funding rounds. While, as we mentioned before, Trulioo raised a total of 80.8 million with 2/3 of them in recent two years which was outdistace the benchmark. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/the-2020-cnbc-disruptor-50-how-we-chose-the-list-of-companies.html),on the other hand, used not only quantitative metrics which was provided by companies included company-submitted data on workforce size and diversity, scalability, and sales and user growth and data from its partner on fundraising, implied valuations and investor.But also, quality information was also needed from participants such as the core technology used in their business and description of recent year developments.As a result, its platform, GlobalGateway, was selected as one of the 50 disruptors by CNBC in 2020. RegTech Supplier Performance Report also ranked the platform number one identity verification tool and Trulioo number three in the Overall RegTech Supplier Rankings for four consecutive years based on the reputation of suppliers, regulatory technology solutions and where they deployed in the world.The company was recognized as the Technology Pioneer by World Economic Forum as well because of the design, development and deployment of new technologies and innovations, and are ready to make significant changes on business and society compared to competitors.


## Recommendations

Although Trulioo may have one of the largest data sources in identity verification industry, information it used to verify identity is stored in a centralised database owned by different entities which are very safe in most of time. However, on one hand, there are still around 2 billion people not included and according to [Blockchain in Digital Identity](https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/digital-identity/), most of them (around 1.1 billion) cannot claim ownership of their identity which keeps them from financial system. Moreover, even people who can verify their identity is vulnerable to hackers' attack that can jeopardize the authenticity of identity verification. On the other hand, company has to keep careful watch of constantly expanding databases filled with sensitive personally identifying infomation.This is why company should launch blockchain authentication to be a supplement of its exiting system. 

By leveraging this new technology, all of the private information used for identity verification such as name, unique identity or social security number, and biometric data.would be stored decentralized. A private key is assigned to the owner for every piece of data that makes this person the only possesser. In this manner, whenever users of system require an identity proof, people simply need to grant access to them by using private keys. And as all information is encrypted stored on the blockchain, there is no need to worry about the authenticity of information. The nature of decentralization and cryptographically secured credentials can guarantee it is almost impossible to steal or fake the data.
